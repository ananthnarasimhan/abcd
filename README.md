##Run file instructions

1.)Open *res/* folder.
2.)Double click on *runproject* to execute the jar file

##Assumptions

I have assumed the following things.
1.)Extinct animals cannot be added into the habitat.
2.)Once an animal is added to a habitat it cannot be removed.
3.)All the habitat is of the same size which is given during declaring the habitat.

##Parts of program complete

All the parts of the program are complete.

##Changes in design after design meeting

I have put arrows for lines connecting the class and the enums.
I have also integrated the functions of SubHabitat class in Habitat class and thus removed the SubHabitat class.
